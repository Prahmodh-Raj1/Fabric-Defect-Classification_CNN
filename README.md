# Fabric-Defect-Classification

This project aims to classify fabric defects into categories such as "holes," "horizontal," and "vertical" using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained to identify and categorize defects in fabric images, providing a reliable solution for quality control in the textile industry.
